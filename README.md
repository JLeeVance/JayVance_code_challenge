### Short About-Me

Hello! Thanks for taking a moment to look over my code_challenge for DataMade. I am a Performer with a BFA in Acting and a Software Engineer with a Certificate in Full-Stack Development from the Flatiron School. I built the code for this challenge with the intent to be reusable. While I deviated from the instructions with the usage of index.js vs the script tags within index.html, I believe this allows reusability of the code for furture development.

### Installation

Assuming you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, run the following commands to build and run your development container.

```
docker-compose build
```

Next, run the app:

```
docker-compose up
```

The console will become a Docker console, giving you Docker logs output. You should now be able to visit the website at http://localhost:8000.
